The bar had a lot of nice, caring employees. They served well on time, and were passionate to work there. They had a lot of good background knowledge and seemed to want to get to know me!

The restaurant/ bar was really crowded, especially on the saturday night my friends and I went there on. We spent a good two hours there! The waiters were kind and energetic, but didn’t seem very interested in serving us.

The venue was well decorated and open. One of the bartenders kept staring at me for a while, then I made an excuse to leave. Most of the men there were really good spirited though!

The area was really dusty and had a weird smell. The people were all really nice, but the environment wasn’t very fun to be in.
